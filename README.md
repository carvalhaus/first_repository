# 1 first_repository
##### This is my first repository in GitHub. Here you be able to know a little bit about me and aims in IT.

My name is João Pedro and I'm brazilian and I work in the Army as a Sergeant in a military unit that that the mission is work in topographical and geospatial projects.
My main duties are to organize, to control all the equipaments and devices related to IT(for example: servers, workstations, network infrastructure), to give user support for my workmates and also to work making purchase processes for new equipaments and materials.
In June 2021, I graduated as a Technologist Systems Analysis and Development at Universidade Estácio de Sá - UNESA and since then I've been studying and developing my habilits and interests at Web Development.
For this reason, you all be able to see my new projects and studies here in my GitHub Reppositories.
